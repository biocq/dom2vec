=== Toxin Experiment ===
2.1) data set -> clean from non Interpro -> remove duplicates -> shuffled data set.
Loading csv(s) -> data set.
Using columns ['uniprot_id', 'toxin', 'seq', 'interpro_domains']
Current df shape: (15496, 4)
Data set shape: (15496, 4)
Cleaning rows of csv(s) from no Interpro domains.
Using columns ['uniprot_id', 'toxin', 'seq', 'interpro_domains']
Removing duplicate instances joining x:interpro_domains and y:toxin columns
Data set shape: (4055, 4)
Count proteins per domain type:
Protein instances with ONLY unknown domains: 43.723797780517884% 
Protein instances with ONLY gap domains: 0.2959309494451295%
Protein instances with ONLY gap and unknown domains: 0.0%
Protein instances with ONLY Interpro domains: 55.980271270036994%
Removing protein instances with only full length unknown or only GAP domains
Starting data set shape: (4055, 4)
Removed instances data frame shape: (1785, 5)
